# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my DSA repository! This collection contains implementations of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving solutions** in Java.  

## 🧠 What's Inside?  
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.  
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, etc.  
- **Leetcode/GeeksforGeeks Solutions**: Solved problems with optimizations and explanations. 

## Folder Structure
